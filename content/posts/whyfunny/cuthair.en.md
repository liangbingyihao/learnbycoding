### Original joke

头发小姐爱上了剪刀先生，哭着说:“我是真的喜欢你，为什麽你不理我呢？”知道后来怎么了吗？后来······剪刀先生就理了她。 

Miss Hair fell in love with Mr. Scissors and cried, "I really like you, why don't you pay attention to me?" Do you know what happened later? Well, Mr. Scissors finally started 'paying attention' to her.


### Joke explanation

In Chinese, "理 (li)" can mean "pay attention to, react to someone's words and actions," which is what Miss Hair expected from Mr. Scissors. However, when "理" is used with "头发" (hair), it means to cut hair, which is Mr. Scissors' actual response to Miss Hair.
